- How to log in and push to Docker Hub using credentials
- End-to-end CI/CD workflow with Docker integration

---

## ðŸ§± Pipeline Stages
| Stage | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Checkout | Clones the source code from GitHub |
| Build Docker Image | Builds a new Docker image using the Dockerfile |
| Login to Docker Hub | Authenticates Jenkins with Docker Hub |
| Push to Docker Hub | Pushes the image to your repository |
