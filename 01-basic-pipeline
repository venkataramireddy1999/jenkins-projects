# 🧩 Project 01 — Basic Jenkins Pipeline

## 🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates how to create a **basic Jenkins Declarative Pipeline** that automates the build, test, and deploy stages for a simple application.  
It’s the foundation for understanding how Jenkins automates the CI/CD process.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout** the code from GitHub  
2. **Build** the application (simulated build step)  
3. **Test** the code (prints test logs)  
4. **Deploy** the application (prints deployment message)

This project uses a simple static web app to simulate the CI/CD workflow.
